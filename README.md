# Interactive Comic Experiment

In collaboration with the awesome artist [Genna](https://twitter.com/GennaElvenEars), this repo is dedicated to a storytelling experiment that's a mix between an online comic and a point-and-click adventure game. The goal is to create an immersive experience that feels like a portal to another world. Instead of creating a comic and putting it on a regular 'ol site, the comic <i>should be</i> the site -- a subtle, but important, bit necessary for creating a better immersion experience.

## To-Do (A rough sketch of where we're going at the moment)

* Finish Script
* Flesh out character cues and movements; build file heirarchy based on this
* Begin to build the engine
