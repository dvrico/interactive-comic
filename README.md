# Interactive Comic Experiment
This is a storytelling experiment that's a mix between a comic and a point-and-click adventure game. The goal is to create an experience that feels like a portal to another world. Instead of creating a comic and putting it on a unique site, the comic <i>is</i> the site -- a subtle, but important, bit necessary for creating a better immersion experience.
